## Welcome to Mahad's CIS 4105 Test Website

Hello,

You've stumbled upon my test website. I'm not sure how you got here, but WELCOME!!! :)

Again, I've just made this page as a test website for CIS 4105.

I'm not sure what else to add here, but here are five public repos that I think are useful to myself:

•	https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap

    o	Useful information about web development.
  
•	https://github.com/MrS0m30n3/youtube-dl-gui
  
    o	A Youtube video downloader with a GUI. If you need any informative video, but think you might not have internet access/ your internet might go down when you need it, just download a video for your personal portfolio.
  
•	https://github.com/3b1b/manim
  
    o	A cool animation engine for explaining math videos (this one piqued my interest the most, since I'm taking a calc course right now).
  
•	https://github.com/labnol/email-studio-gmail-addon
  
    o	An add-on for Gmail, which has numerous features, a personal favorite being the auto-responder.

•	https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui
  
    o	A java decompiler with a GUI, letting you access your .class files.


Ok, Goodbye.
